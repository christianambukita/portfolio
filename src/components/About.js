				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<article>
					My name is Christian Ambukita and I'm an aspiring front-end developer.
					I graduated from Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology with a masters degree
					in Automatic control and Robotics. During my final years of college I
					realised that coding is what I would like to do as a job. After
					graduation I started to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript as I decided to
					become a front-end web developer. My favorite and mainly used
					framework is React. This website showcases some of projects I did
					during my learning process.
